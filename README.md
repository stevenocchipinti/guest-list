==========

A small application that parses a JSON file and prints the data in various ways.

This should be a starting point for beginners to practice their programming
skills with some simple exercises. It uses the following concepts:

- Reading a file
- JSON parsing
- Ruby arrays and hashes
- Foreach loops
- If statements
- String interpolation
- Basic date time functionality (getting the current year)


Exercises
---------

At the top of `app.rb` there are some comments with exercises to complete.


Solutions
---------

There is a branch called `solutions` that has a separate commit for the solution
to each exercise.


How to run it
-------------

Clone this repo, open the directory in a terminal and type:

```
ruby app.rb
```

Alternatively, if you don't know how to use `git`, you could just download (or
copy/paste) `app.rb` instead of cloning.
